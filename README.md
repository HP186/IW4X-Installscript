# IW4X-Installscript

This is a reworked script originally provided by [@linkuso](https://github.com/linkuso/iw4x-linux-server-installscript). 
This script contains multiple fixes and should give you an immaculate experience.

Run install.sh as root and follow the instructions. 
Afterwards you'll have to upload your Modern Warfare 2 basegame to the newly created "MW2" folder.

If you want to save some time with the configuration of the freshly installed server, you can download prebuilt dedicated server configs [here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/269972437393735682/656242057114943489/IW4x_Prebuild_dedi_configs.zip).
